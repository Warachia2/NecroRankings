    <h1>About This Site</h1>

    <p><a href="https://warachia2.github.io/NecroRankings/">Top</a></p>

    <p></p>

    <h3>Leaderboards</h3>
    <p>They exclude known cheaters' records and millisec-bugged records.</p>
    <p>They include unsubmitted PBs and non-Steam platform PBs as far as I know. </p>
    <p>You can send me your/other player's unsubmitted/non-Steam platform PBs if you want.</p>
    <p>Everything on this site is based on these LBs instead of raw in-game LBs.</p>

    <p></p>

    <h3>Registered Players</h3>
    <p>They are shown on LBs pages, and have their own PB pages. (While non-registered players are still count toward ranks.
    <p>Players in community discord server will be registered if I find them not registered yet.
    <p>Players who have any top100 speed/top50 score/top10 extra speed/deathless/top5 extra score records, or in any rankings on my site are checked by me, to be registered or marked as a cheater.
    <p>You can DM me to make me register yourself, or change your name on this site.

    <p></p>

    <h3>Players' Pages</h3>
    <p>They shows score PBs only if they are above thresholds: trying to show score PBs only if they tried to scorerun that character/category.</p>

	<details class="tab">
	<summary>Thresholds</summary>
	<p>10000	Aria, Bard, Cadence, Diamond, Melody, Nocturna</p>
	<p>7500	Bolt, Dorian, Eli, Mary, Monk, Tempo</p>
	<p>1000	Dove</p>
	<p>1	Coda</p>
	<p>50000 &#009;	Story, 9char, 13char</p>
	<p>Same thresholds for Hard/NR/Rando Score.</p>
	<p>0.8x for Phasing/Mystery Score.</p>
	</details><p></p>

    <p>You still can check your score PBs below thresholds by mousing over them.</p>
    <p>Cadence deathless PBs lower than 10-1-2 are also hidden.</p>
